# **Transformers from Scratch**

This repository implements the **Transformer architecture** from scratch in Python, focusing on its core computational principles and mathematical foundations. The project is designed to provide a granular understanding of the modelâ€™s internals, including self-attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and multi-head attention, which are critical for parallelized sequence modeling. Each component is implemented step-by-step, with detailed explanations of the linear algebra and optimization techniques involved.

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the seminal paper *"Attention is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017)*, has become the backbone of state-of-the-art models in NLP, such as **BERT**, **GPT**, and **T5**. By reconstructing the architecture from the ground up, this project enables a deeper comprehension of how Transformers process sequences efficiently, achieve contextual understanding, and perform complex tasks such as translation and summarization.

## **Why Transformers?**
Transformers form the backbone of powerful models like **BERT**, **GPT**, and **T5**, which have revolutionized NLP by enabling unparalleled performance on tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering. This project not only helps you understand their inner workings but also prepares you to build upon them for real-world applications.
